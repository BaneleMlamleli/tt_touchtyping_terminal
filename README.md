# tt_touchtyping_terminal

My touch typing material for [TT](https://github.com/lemnos/tt), a terminal based typing test for teaching myself touch typing.

## My notes

- To use custom words: **_tt -showwpm -bold ~/stories/A_Coward.txt -n 50 -g 3_**
- Pressing **_escape_** at any point restarts the test.
- **_C-c_** exits the test.
- **_right_** moves to the next test.
- **_left_** moves to the previous test.
- **_tt -quotes en_** Starts quote mode with the builtin quote list 'en'.
- **_tt -n 10 -g 5_** produces a test consisting of 50 randomly drawn words in 5 groups of 10 words each.
- **_tt -t 10_** starts a timed test lasting 10 seconds.
- **_tt -theme gruvbox_** Starts tt with the gruvbox theme.
