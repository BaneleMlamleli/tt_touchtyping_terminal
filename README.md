# tt_touchtyping_terminal

My touch typing material for [TT](https://github.com/lemnos/tt), a terminal based typing test for teaching myself touch typing.

## My notes

- tt -showwpm -bold ~/stories/A_Coward.txt -n 50 -g 3
- Pressing escape at any point restarts the test.
- C-c exits the test.
- right moves to the next test.
- left moves to the previous test.
- tt -quotes en Starts quote mode with the builtin quote list 'en'.
- tt -n 10 -g 5 produces a test consisting of 50 randomly drawn words in 5 groups of 10 words each.
- tt -t 10 starts a timed test lasting 10 seconds.
- tt -theme gruvbox Starts tt with the gruvbox theme.
